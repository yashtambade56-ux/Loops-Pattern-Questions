# Loops-Pattern-Questions
This repository contains 8 loop-based Python problems focusing on iteration, mathematical logic, and pattern creation. 
You will practice for-loops, while-loops, nested loops, and common problem-solving techniques like checking prime numbers, generating Fibonacci sequences, and printing star patterns.
These questions form part of the bigger 50-question Python Basics Practice Set, covering the Loops & Patterns category.

✅Topics Covered
1. For loops and while loops
2. Skipping items using continue
3. Pattern creation using nested loops
4. Mathematical logic: factorial, prime numbers, Fibonacci
5. Counting digits manually
6. Working with number ranges
7. Star and pyramid pattern logic
8. Loop-based addition and iteration techniques
